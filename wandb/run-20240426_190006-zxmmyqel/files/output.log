/home/zhiyu/anaconda3/envs/trl/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/utils/checkpoint.py:460: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: please pass in use_reentrant=True or use_reentrant=False explicitly. The default value of use_reentrant will be updated to be False in the future. To maintain current behavior, pass use_reentrant=True. It is recommended that you use use_reentrant=False. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
  warnings.warn(
The input hidden states seems to be silently casted in float32, this might be related to the fact you have upcasted embedding or layer norm layers in float32. We will cast back the input in torch.float16.
