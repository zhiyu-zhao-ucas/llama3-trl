/home/zhiyu/software/trl/trl/trainer/dpo_trainer.py:1202: UserWarning: compute_loss is only implemented for DPODataCollatorWithPadding, and you passed a datacollator that is different than DPODataCollatorWithPadding - you might see unexpected behavior. Alternatively, you can implement your own prediction_step method if you are using a custom data collator

/home/zhiyu/anaconda3/envs/trl/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/utils/checkpoint.py:460: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: please pass in use_reentrant=True or use_reentrant=False explicitly. The default value of use_reentrant will be updated to be False in the future. To maintain current behavior, pass use_reentrant=True. It is recommended that you use use_reentrant=False. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
  warnings.warn(
The input hidden states seems to be silently casted in float32, this might be related to the fact you have upcasted embedding or layer norm layers in float32. We will cast back the input in torch.float16.
Could not estimate the number of tokens of the input, floating-point operations will not be computed
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
